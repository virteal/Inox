# Inox

Inox is a minimalist functional concatenative dynamic programming language.

It is a multi dialect basic/forth/smalltalk/lisp/prolog/erlang inspired stack based language.

Inox targets the webassembly virtual machine but runs on other architectures too. It is a multi dialect language because it values diversity.

This is the reference implementation. It defines the syntax and semantic of the language. Production quality version of the virtual machine would
have to be hard coded in some machine code to be efficient.

I started working on it at the beginning of june 2021. It's not working at all yet. The first implementation will run in a regular javascript virtual machine, nodejs typically.
