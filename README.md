# Inox

Inox is a multi dialect basic/forth/smalltalk/lisp/prolog/erlang inspired
minimalist concatenative safe dynamic programming language.

Inox targets the webassembly virtual machine but runs on other architectures
too. It is a multi dialect language because it values diversity.

This is the reference implementation. It defines the syntax and semantic
of the language. Production quality version of the virtual machine would
have to be hard coded in some machine code to be efficient.
